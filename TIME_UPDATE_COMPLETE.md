    START_TIME = now.replace(hour=17, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
else:
    START_TIME = (now + timedelta(days=1)).replace(hour=17, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

END_TIME = (START_TIME + timedelta(hours=12)).replace(hour=5, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
```

### 2. **Frontend Countdown (index.html)**
```javascript
// Countdown to 5 PM
target.setHours(17, 0, 0, 0); // Changed from 19 to 17

// If it's past 5 PM today, set for tomorrow
if (now.getHours() >= 17) {  // Changed from 19 to 17
    target.setDate(target.getDate() + 1);
}
```
