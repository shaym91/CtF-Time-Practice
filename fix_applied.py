"""
Quick fix for the KeyError issue in the deployed CTF platform
This script adds proper error handling for missing users
"""

# The main issue is that users can be in session but not in the users dictionary
# This happens when the server restarts but sessions persist

# Here's the fix that needs to be applied to app.py:

FIX_CODE = '''
# In the challenges() function, replace:
username = session['username']
solved_ids = users[username]['solved']

# With:
username = session['username']

# Check if user exists in users dictionary, if not redirect to login
if username not in users:
    session.pop('username', None)
    return redirect(url_for('login'))

solved_ids = users[username]['solved']

# Similar fixes needed in challenge() and submit() functions
'''
